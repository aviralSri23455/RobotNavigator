# Simulation of an Autonomous Robot in a Warehouse

## Objective: Develop a simulation in Python for an autonomous robot navigating a rectangular warehouse measuring 10 meters by 10 meters. The robot should move from the starting point at (0, 0) to the destination at (7, 9).

## Constraints:

1.	The warehouse dimensions are 10 meters by 10 meters.
2.	The robot can only travel at a speed of 0.1 m/s.
3.	After traveling for 0.1 seconds, the robot must stop for 2 seconds.
4.	The robot must avoid any obstacles (if applicable).
5.	The robot's movement must be within the boundaries of the warehouse.
